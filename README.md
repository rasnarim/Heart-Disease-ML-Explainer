# Heart-Disease-ML-Explainer
This project predicts heart disease using machine learning models and explains predictions with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). It includes data exploration, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and SHAP visualizations to interpret how features contribute to heart disease predictions.
